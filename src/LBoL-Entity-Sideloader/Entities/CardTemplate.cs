The colour is important for pooling rules. In the example, the card could only be found if the player has permanent source of Red, Blue and White mana regardless of the card's cost. If the list is left empty (Colors: new List<ManaColor>() {}) the card won't have any colour, for example, Tools don't have any color. This should not be confused with ManaColor.Colorless. Card having ManaColor.Colorless colour means that the card cannot be found unless the player has source of Colorless mana i.e. Magic Mallet. Filthless World would be an example of a Colorless card. Technically, it's ok for a card to be Colorless and have some other colors like List<ManaColor>() {ManaColor.Colorless, ManaColor.Red}. This would require a source of Red and Colorless mana for the card to be pooled. ManaColor options ManaColor.Any and ManaColor.Philosophy should never be used here and will result in error used.
